## About

First things to know about \<T\>LAPACK:

1. We write &nbsp; \<T\>LAPACK &nbsp; whenever it is possible. This includes all software documentation, discussions, and presentation.
2. We say it &nbsp; T-L-A-PACK &nbsp; .
3. We use &nbsp; `tlapack` &nbsp; for files, folders, and links, to make it more portable and easier to use.

\<T\>LAPACK provides:

- Precision-neutral function template implementation

## Installation

\<T\>LAPACK is built and installed with [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

### Getting CMake

You can either download binaries for the [latest stable](https://cmake.org/download/#latest) or [previous](https://cmake.org/download/#previous) release of CMake,
or build the [current development distribution](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake) from source. CMake is also available in the APT repository on Ubuntu 16.04 or higher.

### Building and Installing \<T\>LAPACK

\<T\>LAPACK can be build following the standard CMake recipe

```sh
cmake -B build .      # configuration step
cmake --build build   # build step
```

To install \<T\>LAPACK in your system, use

```sh
cmake -B build -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install . # configuration step
cmake --build build --target install                      # install step
```

### CMake options

Standard environment variables affect CMake.
Some examples are

    CXX                 C++ compiler
    CXXFLAGS            C++ compiler flags
    LDFLAGS             linker flags

The Fortran and C wrappers to \<T\>LAPACK also use, among others,

    CC                  C compiler
    CFLAGS              C compiler flags
    FC                  Fortran compiler
    FFLAGS              Fortran compiler flags

- [This page](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-env-variables.7.html) lists the environment variables that have special meaning to CMake.

It is also possible to pass variables to CMake during the configuration step using the `-D` flag.
The following example builds \<T\>LAPACK in debug mode inside the directory `build`

```sh
mkdir build
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
cmake --build build
```

- [This page](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-variables.7.html) documents variables that are provided by CMake or have meaning to CMake when set by project code.

We also continuously test \<T\>LAPACK with optimized BLAS and LAPACK implementations: OpenBLAS, Intel MKL, Flame BLIS, LAPACK, Netlib BLAS.

> [!NOTE]
> \<T\>LAPACK supports Eigen v3.4.0 after applying the patch [9210e71f](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/commit/9210e71fb378a0f1542272506dc2759b6c147237). This commit fixes an ADL conflict between `Eigen::internal::size()` and `std::size()`.

## Documentation

The documentation of \<T\>LAPACK is generated using Doxygen. The documentation is available online at https://tlapack.github.io/tlapack. Alternatively, you can generate the documentation in your local machine. To do so, follow the steps below:

- Install Doxygen in your local machine. See the [Doxygen installation page](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html) for more details.

- In the top directory of \<T\>LAPACK, run `doxygen docs/Doxyfile` to generate the \<T\>LAPACK documentation via Doxygen in your local machine.

Additional information about the software can be found in the [Wiki pages of the project](https://github.com/tlapack/tlapack/wiki).

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tlapack/tlapack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute to \<T\>LAPACK.

## Testing

\<T\>LAPACK is continuously tested on Ubuntu, MacOS and Windows using GNU compilers. See the latest test results in the [Github Actions](https://github.com/tlapack/tlapack/actions) webpage for \<T\>LAPACK. The tests split into three categories:

- Test routines in [test/src](test/src) using

  1. various precision types: `float`, `double`, `std::complex<float>`, `std::complex<double>` and `Eigen::half`.

  2. various matrix and vector data structures: `tlapack::LegacyMatrix`, `Eigen::Matrix` and `std::experimental::mdspan` (the latter from `https://github.com/kokkos/mdspan`).

- Tests from [testBLAS](https://github.com/tlapack/testBLAS) for good conformance with BLAS standards.

- [BLAS++ testers](https://github.com/icl-utk-edu/blaspp/tree/master/test) and [LAPACK++ testers](https://github.com/icl-utk-edu/lapackpp/tree/master/test) for measuring performance and accuracy compared to LAPACKE.

To test \<T\>LAPACK, build with `BUILD_TESTING=ON`. Then, run `ctest` inside the build directory.
